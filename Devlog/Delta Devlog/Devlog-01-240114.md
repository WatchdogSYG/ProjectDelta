Welcome to the fortnightly Devlog for Project Delta. I'll aim to write one of these every second Sunday. I'm writing these in Obsidian so hopefully the md flavour works well with GitHub.

## Intro and Summary
Like many starting indie game devs, I have more game ideas than time to complete them. This leads to sizeable dream projects being started and then migrated to the next project so my hard drive ends up really being a playground of small assignments that result in skill development rather than a finished product. While this is not good on paper, I still come out of these phases with two things: skills, and reuseable code - striving for modularity and granularity in the classes I make, while being as fast as I think I can be with prototyping.

There are skills and assets that will be shared between my projects until one of them finds their footing and ends up being a real saleable product in the making.

As of today: I have the following Projects with the following background material that can be used in further projects.

| Project | Skills | Code & Assets |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Delta - A goofy cooking game set on a sandy desert planet, where you gain favour with food. | - CSV files informing data tables and object properties<br>- CustomStencil usage in outlines and other PPM tricks<br>- Screen space widget positioning and scaling<br>- UI templating using Named Widgets for layout templating and BP inheritance for functionality templating.<br>- UI Animations<br>- Landscape object in UE with height map. | - `InventoryComponent`<br>- Generic First Person arms and gun rig with animations |
| Echo - A story-rich fantasy shooter where fights are centered around controlling multiple characters simultaneously through a time-reversal mechanic. | - Custom UI elements, animations and transitions<br>- 3D world widgets display<br>- Third person camera functionality<br>- Third person projectile spawning, collision, damage, and templating<br>- ResourceComponent that deals with damage, healing, natural regen, death, widget communication for multiple types of resources in a modular way.<br>- Setting up a spell interface so that spell classes can be assigned at runtime.

## Looking and Selecting Actors
### Outline Parameters
This section is a follow on from work that I did last year trying to figure out how to work the postprocess effects around CustomDepth and CustomStencil to create outlines. I've defined three sets of parameters for different highlighting scenarios and saved them in a [MaterialParameterCollection]([Material Parameter Collections | Unreal Engine Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/Materials/ParameterCollections/)).

*Material Paramater Collection for ouline colours and Stencil Values*
![[Pasted image 20240107113122.png]]
*PostProcessMaterial that gets an outline from CustomStencil offsets and assigns a colour to the outline. Not sure if there is a better way to switch-case between stencil values.*
![[Pasted image 20240107124157.png]]

My `BP_FirstpersonCharacter` has a Collision Capsule that will determine the closest actor to the crosshair (centre of the viewport) in screen space and send `OnStartLook()` and `OnEndLook()` messages accordingly so that only the closest actor to the middle of the screen is highlighted. This is so that there is some "auto aim" on selectable objects so that the player does not have to perfectly position their crosshair on the object.

Actor BPs that implement the `Lookable` interface will provide functionality to the actor upon receiving an `OnStartLook()` and `OnEndLook()` message. For now, the actors will set their CustomStencil value to the Green outline, indicating that the player is able to interact with that upon a button press.

*A Collision Capsule that detects the overlapped actors able to be interacted with.*

*Exactly one (closest to the centre) actor is highlighted if multiple actors are within the interaction volume.*

### Selection Interface
If an actor implements the `Selectable` interface, the user can press the Interaction button and select the actor that is currently highlighted. This can be used to pick up objects or open a crafting menu etc.

## Creating FPS Arms
I used this tutorial to model and rig low poly arms.

[Rigging FPS Arms - FPS Game With Unity & Blender (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DSK3K4mCFE)

Instead of going to mid/high poly for now, I just used a subdivision surface modifier to smooth out the shapes, which is good enough for prototyping. I'll have to revisit this in the next art pass as the arms are very important for an FPS. The material is made in Unreal and is just a base colour with roughness and metallic values.

Lessons from this tutorial:
- Elbow and finger joint topology is important so bending animations don't clip. Dissolve the edges and put a "V" shape in.
- For the IK Target bone on the hand, make it bigger than the actual hand bone so it's easier to select.

*LowPoly arm mesh and rig which is symmetrised and mirrored about X.*

## Creating a Gun
Based off a random Glock image i found on the internet, I created a gun model with 4 separate mesh objects joined into one.
- Slide
- Body AND Barrel (these are not animated)
- Mag
- Trigger

The Body Bone is the root and the rest of the bones are parented to the body bone.
*Gun Reference and mag highlighted*

No Animations were set up for the gun, as the tutorials suggested that it should all be done in the arms blend file.
## Animating the Arms and Gun
This playlist by David Stenfors was really good, stepping through the procedure to get from animations to FBX to Unreal BP.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2ZqWDUVWoY&list=PLn8ROcXT8fZgjdv4w6FczF8ziXkavUxdu

The main lessons learnt here are the following:
- Parent the gun to the hand bone using the "Child Of" constraint and Set Inverse when done.
- Make sure the camera is the same FOV and in the same relative position to the mesh as the in-game camera.
- No need to use the NLA editor as Unreal can blend anims.
- Don't need to key the arms for gun movements and vice versa. "Bake Animations" in the FBX export options will do that for you.
- Export only the arms from this blend scene (mesh and armature), and set up a separate blend scene for the gun. Link the gun collection and remove the root bone transforms (rotation and location) so the gun animates at the origin. The Unreal socket on the baked arm animations will move it for you. Unsure if this applies to the scale.

## Fresnel Shader For Shields
This is a simple one, shield effects are common. This implementation is simple and I can add another texture lerp and animate banding later.
